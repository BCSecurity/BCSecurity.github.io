            The attack typically begins with a <b>phishing lure</b> – often an
            email or compromised website – that tricks users into downloading
            what appears to be a legitimate document (for example, a PDF file)
            but is actually a specially crafted shortcut. Upon execution, the
            malicious .LNK file triggers a multi-stage infection chain through
            the WebDAV protocol, ultimately delivering malware to the victim’s
            machine. This campaign stands out for its
            <b>abuse of legitimate web technologies and Windows components</b>:
            by hosting malware on WebDAV (an HTTP-based file-sharing service)
            and using trusted Windows utilities to execute payloads, the
            attackers can bypass many security controls similar to what is found
            at easy-software.com any.run . The final payloads observed include
            information-stealing malware and remote access trojans, which can

              >exfiltrate sensitive data and give attackers control of the
              compromised host</b
            >. <br /><br />This report provides a
            <b>comprehensive analysis</b> of the campaign. We detail how the
            attack is carried out—from the initial phishing contact to the
            execution of the malware—while avoiding overly technical payload
            specifics. Key takeaways for defenders include the need for
            heightened awareness of unusual WebDAV activity, strict handling of
            shortcut files, and layered mitigation strategies. The goal is to
            inform both cybersecurity professionals and decision-makers of this
            emerging threat, and to recommend actionable steps to detect and
            disrupt similar attacks in the future.

            </div>
            <br />
            Threat actors are hosting malicious shortcut files on WebDAV servers
            accessible over HTTP/HTTPS, allowing malware downloads over ports
            commonly allowed through firewalls . In one case, a .LNK file
            disguised as a PDF document was hosted on a WebDAV share (e.g.
            http://;&lt;server&gt;/.../document.pdf.lnk), tricking users into
            downloading what looked like a harmless file according to

              <b>Phishing as Initial Access:</b>
            </div>
            <br />
            The infection chain likely begins with
            <b>spear-phishing emails</b>. In observed incidents, attackers
            emailed targets either a link to a
            <b>ZIP archive containing a malicious shortcut</b> or directly to a
            WebDAV-hosted .LNK file. <br /><br />
            <b>Drive-by downloads</b> were also used: visiting a compromised
            website automatically redirected victims to a WebDAV folder,
            prompting them to download the malicious .LNK file unwittingly.
            <div class="subheading-02 mt-5">
              <b>Malicious Shortcut Execution:</b>
            </div>
            <br />
            Opening the malicious shortcut triggers hidden commands that
            <b>leverage built-in Windows utilities</b> to fetch and run malware.
            For example, a .LNK file can silently execute a command-line that
            launches PowerShell or mshta.exe (a legitimate Microsoft HTML
            application host) to download the next-stage payload. <br /><br />
            In one variant, the shortcut executed cmd.exe to copy a malicious
            batch script from the WebDAV share onto the local system and then
            ran it as presented in the article by
            <a
              href="https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/client-side-exploitation/"
              >any.run</a
            >. <br /><br />These techniques enable attackers to run code on the
            victim’s system without dropping a conventional executable at first,
            helping evade antivirus detection.
            <div class="subheading-02 mt-5">
              <b>Multi-Stage Infection Chain: </b>
            </div>
            <br />
            The campaign employs a multi-stage approach. The initial .LNK file
            (stage 1) pulls in a secondary script or payload (stage 2) via
            WebDAV or other HTTP requests, which in turn downloads and installs
            the <b>final malware</b> (stage 3). This final payload has been
            identified in different cases as info-stealers (e.g. Lumma Stealer)
            and remote access trojans (e.g. <b>AsyncRAT, Amadey bot</b>), often
            delivered in sequence. <br /><br />The use of stages means the
            <b
              >actual malicious payload is only fetched and executed after
              several steps</b
            >, making detection harder until the last stage when the malware is
            already running.
            <div class="subheading-02 mt-5">
              <b>Evasion and Masquerading: </b>
            </div>
            <br />
            The attackers use <b>evasion techniques</b> to avoid detection and
            user suspicion. The shortcut files are
            <b>masqueraded with double extensions and familiar icons</b>
            (e.g. a file named "Invoice.pdf.lnk" with a PDF icon) to appear
            legitimate. <br /><br />
            The campaign also abuses
            <b>legitimate services and binaries</b>: for instance, hosting
            malicious content on trusted cloud platforms (Dropbox, Cloudflare,
            Google AMP) to blend in with normal traffic , and using Windows
            <b>“living-off-the-land” binaries (LOLBins)</b> like mshta.exe,
            wmic.exe, or even the Windows ssh.exe client to execute malicious
            code. Additionally, command scripts are obfuscated (e.g. PowerShell
            commands with base64 or special characters) to hinder analysis and
            detection.

            <br />
            Analysis of the campaign indicates a
            <b>broad targeting scope</b>. Reported incidents have affected
            organizations in
            <b

            multi-stage payloads. If successful, it can lead to
            <b>data theft</b> and <b>further compromise</b>
            of affected endpoints. Similar campaigns have been assessed by
            well-known security vendors in the past such as Cyble , Orange Cyber
            Defence and Zscaler but in isolated incidents ( See references in
            section 8 ) . It has not yet been reported with all 4 malware
            strains chained together in a single infection.

            <br />
            Recent findings show that <b>threat actors are shifting</b> from
            traditional SMB-based lateral movements to <b>WebDAV</b> for initial
            file retrieval, evading standard outbound traffic blocks on port
            445. Additionally, <b>new payload obfuscation</b> methods—such as
            embedding malicious scripts in .mp4 or .pdf overlays—enable
            attackers to slip past basic antivirus signatures and email filters.

              <li class="mt-4">
                <b>Initial Contact – Phishing or Redirect:</b>The victim
                receives a malicious content trigger, typically via email. This
                could be a direct attachment (e.g. a ZIP file containing a
                shortcut) or a URL pointing to a download. In some cases, users
                were led to a compromised website that automatically redirected
                them to a WebDAV server, resulting in an Explorer window or
                download prompt for a file that appears legitimate <br /><br />
                The goal at this stage is to entice the user to click a link or
                open a file, initiating the infection.
              </li>
              <li class="mt-4">
                <b>Connection to Malicious WebDAV Share: </b>As soon as the user
                takes the bait (clicks the link or opens the provided file), the
                victim’s system connects to the attacker's WebDAV server to
                retrieve the malicious .LNK payload. WebDAV, being an extension
                of HTTP, allows the remote file (the shortcut) to be fetched
                over port 80/443 just like a web page according to
                easy-software.com <br /><br />For example, one phishing link led
                to a WebDAV URL
                hxxp://.../Downloads/Instruction_695-18121-002_Rev.PDF.lnk,
                hosting a fake PDF shortcut on a remote server . In another
                variant, the email attachment was an Internet Shortcut file
                (*.url); when launched, this .url file caused the system to
                download the actual .LNK file into a temporary directory (via
                WebDAV) without any further user action. <br /><br />At this
                stage, the malicious shortcut is now on the victim’s machine (in
                memory or disk), poised for execution.
              </li>
              <li class="mt-4">
                <b>Execution of the Malicious Shortcut: </b>The victim
                (believing the file to be benign) attempts to open the
                downloaded "document" — in reality, executing the .LNK file.
                Windows Shortcut (.LNK) files can carry embedded commands in
                their properties, which execute when the shortcut is opened. In
                this campaign, the .LNK is configured to run a hidden command
                that initiates the malware delivery. For instance, an analyzed
                .LNK file contained a command to launch the Windows Command
                Processor (cmd.exe) with parameters: it copied a malicious
                script from the WebDAV share to the local drive and then ran it.
                <br /><br />In another case, the shortcut targeted
                C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\ssh.exe (the Windows SSH client)
                instead of the usual cmd.exe, in order to appear less
                suspicious; it exploited SSH’s options to execute a follow-on
                payload via PowerShell.Despite variations, the result is the
                same: the .LNK file covertly executes a command on the victim’s
                system.
              </li>
              <li class="mt-4">
                <b>Command Launch and Payload Download:</b>The command invoked
                by the shortcut now pulls in the next-stage malware. Attackers
                often rely on built-in scripting engines or utilities at this
                stage to fetch and execute code. A common technique observed is
                using PowerShell or WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to
                download a malicious script from the attacker’s server.

                For example, the .LNK might run a PowerShell one-liner that
                connects back to the WebDAV server (or another URL) to download
                a malicious script or file. In one documented case, the LNK via
                SSH launched a PowerShell command that used mshta.exe
                (Microsoft’s HTML application host) to execute a malicious HTA
                (HTML application) hosted on a cloud service as presented by

                ><br /><br />These living-off-the-land binaries (like
                PowerShell, mshta.exe, cmd.exe, etc.) are legitimate Windows
                programs, so their misuse helps the attack blend in. At this
                point, the malware (or an intermediary dropper) is retrieved
                from the remote location and executed in memory or saved to
                disk.

                <b>Secondary Execution & Multi-Stage Loading: </b>The downloaded
                payload (often a script or DLL) executes to install the final
                malware. In many cases, the download is a loader or dropper
                whose job is to fetch or unpack the actual malware payload. For
                example, a PowerShell script might reach out to a hard-coded URL
                or cloud service (such as Pastebin or an Amazon S3 bucket) to
                download an encoded malware component. <br /><br />That
                component could be a ZIP archive or an encrypted blob containing
                the final implant. The dropper may then use a technique like DLL
                sideloading or process injection to load the final stage without
                spawning a new suspicious process. <br /><br />
                By the end of this stage, the full malware (e.g. an infostealer
                or RAT) is running on the victim system. Notably, each step in
                this chain can be individually obfuscated or masked (for
                instance, using shortened URLs, encryption, or legitimate
                hosting services) so that no single action clearly exposes the
                malware until the very end.

                <b>Full Compromise and Objectives: </b> Once the final malware
                is active, it will typically achieve the attacker’s objectives,
                such as stealing data (credentials, browser data, cryptocurrency
                wallets, etc.) and/or establishing remote access for the
                attacker . For instance, Lumma Stealer exfiltrates passwords and
                wallet data, while AsyncRAT provides a backdoor for the
                adversary to control the machine. <br /><br />At this stage, the
                attacker may also take steps to maintain persistence on the
                system (e.g. adding registry run keys or scheduled tasks, though
                those details are part of the payload’s behavior and are
                typically beyond the initial infection chain). The attack chain
                from phishing to final payload can occur in a matter of minutes,
                emphasizing the need for real-time detection at earlier stages
                to prevent damage.

              <b>Attack Chain Summary:</b>
            </div>
            <br />
            In summary, this WebDAV + LNK campaign follows a classic "delivery –
            execution – payload" pattern with a novel twist on the delivery
            mechanism. By using WebDAV to host malicious content, the attackers
            circumvent some traditional delivery controls (since WebDAV traffic
            looks like normal web traffic) and by using .LNK files, they exploit
            a Windows feature that might be less scrutinized than an EXE. The
            layered approach (phishing lure → WebDAV fetch → LNK execution →
            script download → malware launch) shows a deliberate attempt to
            bypass security filters and sandboxes at each step. Each link in the
            chain is relatively innocuous on its own (e.g. an HTTP request here,
            a PowerShell command there), only becoming malicious when the whole
            sequence completes. This underlines the importance of analyzing
            incidents holistically and monitoring for subtle indicators at each
            stage of execution.

                    the ultimate malicious logic is in the code from Pastebin,

              The script first verifies the system’s internet connectivity by
              sending HTTP requests to two distinct domains: 360.net and
              baidu.com. These requests ensure the system is online before

                Given the errors about “missing the terminator” and the presence
                of random Unicode characters, it’s highly likely that the script
                expects the analysts to do the final string fixes in memory at
                runtime. Hence, seeing partial or broken syntax when trying to
                run it directly.
                <br /><br />
                <b>Script Analysis:</b> <br /><br />
                The obfuscated PowerShell script employs Unicode substitution
                (e.g., 恤 → S, 恑 → y) and control character insertion (e.g., →
                hex 0x14) to disguise key components like the URL
                http://60.14.0.0/netsetup.exe (hidden as 60net), while redundant
                variables (e.g., $Lf恤Lf恤...) and split strings (e.g., Sys +
                tem.Net.WebClient) evade static analysis. The script dynamically
                constructs and executes a downloader using .NET classes
                (System.Net.WebClient.DownloadFile) to fetch a payload into
                %LOCALAPPDATA% and runs it via Start-Process, leveraging
                PowerShell’s flexibility to bypass basic detection mechanisms.

            The IDAT loader attack (HIJACK LOADER) leveraged steganography as an
            evasion technique. While steganographic methods, often referred to
            as "Stego" techniques, are widely recognized, their role in
            bypassing security defenses is crucial to understanding how to
            counter such threats effectively. <br /><br />
            Steganography conceals malicious code or files within media content,
            such as images or videos, by embedding the payload in pixel data,
            making detection challenging. <br /><br />
            For instance, in an image with a 24-bit pixel depth (which supports
            16.7 million colors), hidden code can be placed in the least
            significant bits (LSB) of each pixel without noticeably altering the
            image’s appearance. <br /><br />
            Although media files can be scanned, signature-based detection may
            fail to recognize hidden threats due to obfuscation. This enables a
            malware loader to drop the infected media, extract the concealed
            payload, and execute it in memory. In this case, while the image
            exhibited visible distortions, the obfuscation was still effective
            in evading security mechanisms. <br /><br />
            MSIEXEC.exe also spawns another process and drops a binary under the
            path . C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\7Q0KYZB9F24T9K51YQ.exe .

            This file is not a PNG , but a dropper type of file with the IDAT

            <br />
            IDAT refers to the "image data" chunk within a Portable Network
            Graphics (PNG) image file format. True to its name, the loader
            locates and extracts the Amadey Bot code, which is smuggled onto the
            victim machine within the IDAT block of an embedded steganographic
            .PNG image. <br /><br />
            The user is not intended to see the PNG image. The image used in
            this specific attack was visually distorted. The initial download
            was an executable named 7Q0KYZB9F24T9K51YQ.exe, delivered as part of
            the multi-stage attack flow. Once again shellcode is injected into
            more.com <br /><br />
            The first stage is responsible for retrieving or loading the second
            stage, which contains a module table along with the primary
            instrumentation shellcode. This second stage facilitates shellcode
            injection into either a legitimate DLL or a newly created process.
            Once injected, the main instrumentation shellcode proceeds to
            decrypt and execute the final payload, dynamically adjusting its
            injection method or execution flow based on the file type and
            configuration settings. <br /><br />
            Notably, in this instance, the IDAT modules were directly embedded
            within the primary executable, which was retrieved from
            172[.]67[.]143[.]25 . A very detailed code analysis of Hijack Loader

            The threat actor behind this campaign also installs the Amadey bot
            in the %temp% directory, using the same method of injecting code
            into "more.com." This injected code subsequently implants the final
            Amadey bot payload into "explorer.exe." <br /><br />
            Once, when Amadey initiates its execution, the malware duplicates
            itself into a TEMP folder (sometimes naming itself bguuwe.exe ,
            different in our analysis instance ).

            To ensure persistence, the malware creates a Task Scheduler entry
            called "NodeJS Web Framework" that is set to execute a copy of the
            Amadey bot located in the %Appdata% directory.

            Subsequently, Amadey sets up C2 communication and transmits a system
            profile to the adversary’s server. While active, Amadey takes
            screenshots at regular intervals and stores them in the TEMP
            directory, ready to be transmitted to the C2 server with subsequent
            POST requests. Amadey has a very specific structure of POST
            requests, that can be used to identify it with a high degree of
